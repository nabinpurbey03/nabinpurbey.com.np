        <h1>About <span class="me">Me</span></h1>
        <p>I am currently in my third year of the integrated Bachelors program, a four-year course that has provided me
            with
            a robust foundation in various academic disciplines. I inspired a lot by innovation and technology and love
            to
            code. <br> <br>
            I specialize in <b> Java programming</b>, demonstrating a strong command of its syntax and staying abreast
            of the latest
            features in modern Java. My proficiency extends to key data structures like HashMap and HashSet, and I
            possess a
            solid understanding of network programming, particularly in TCP/IP and WebSocket technologies. I have
            successfully tackled numerous challenges on platforms like LeetCode, showcasing my problem-solving skills
            with
            Java. I possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including C, Dart, PHP, and JavaScript.
